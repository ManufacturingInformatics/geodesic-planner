This repo is to act as a supplement to the work provided in our paper titled ***"Generating Continuous Paths On Learned Constraint Manifolds Using Policy Search"***. It is not designed to be production-level code, rather to inform readers as to our methodology.

**UPDATE (Date here):** Our work was accepted to IEEE/RSJ IROS 2024!
